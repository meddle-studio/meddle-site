        <h1>Strategic Partnership</h1>
        
        <h2>Senior creative direction and brand strategy, without the full-time commitment.</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">You're scaling. Your brand needs consistent oversight, strategic direction, and creative firepower—but you're not ready for (or don't need) a $250K+ full-time executive hire. That's where I come in. Strategic Partnership gives you direct access to a founder-led creative partner with 15 years of design and development leadership—the strategic depth of a creative agency with the agility and accountability of working with one seasoned expert.</p>

        <h3>What You Get</h3>
        
        <p>Think of this as your brand's insurance policy and growth accelerator rolled into one. I become an extension of your team—providing strategic guidance, creative direction, and hands-on support whenever you need it. You get a "mini agency" for the price of one experienced creative, with zero overhead.</p>

        </section>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        
        <p>Strategic Partnership is flexible by design. We establish a monthly commitment (typically 15-30 hours) and a communication cadence that works for your team. Some months you'll use every hour. Other months, you might need just a quick strategy check-in. Either way, you have consistent access to senior-level expertise.</p>

        <section aria-labelledby="monthly-rhythm">
            <h4 id="monthly-rhythm">Typical Monthly Rhythm:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1-2 scheduled strategy or planning sessions</li>
                <li>Ongoing Slack/email access for ad-hoc questions</li>
                <li>Review of 2-4 key deliverables or initiatives</li>
                <li>1 stakeholder presentation or workshop (as needed)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <p>Partnership agreements typically run 3-12 months, with the option to scale up, scale down, or renew based on your evolving needs.</p>

        <h3>Who You're Working With</h3>
        
        <p>I'm Matthew Bacon, founder and Creative Director of Meddle. Over 15 years, I've built brands and led creative teams at the intersection of strategy, design, and development. Most recently, I served as SVP of brand strategy and creative at Nymbus, leading a global design team. Before that, I held creative leadership roles at Kony (acquired by Temenos) and Community Techknowledge (acquired by Bonterra).</p>

        <p>Meddle is a lean, founder-led studio—which means you work directly with me, not junior designers or account managers. I bridge the gap between high-level strategy and technical execution, so I don't just advise, I can actually build. Whether you need someone to shape brand direction, review a complex design system, or roll up their sleeves in Figma or code, I do both the thinking and the making.</p>

        <h3>Investment</h3>
        
        <p>Strategic Partnership starts at $8K/month for 15 hours of dedicated time and strategic access. Most clients invest $10K-$15K/month depending on scope and intensity. Custom arrangements available for unique situations.</p>

        <h3>Is Strategic Partnership Right for You?</h3>
        
        <p>This offering is built for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Growing companies (Series A-C startups, scaling SMBs) that need executive-level creative talent but aren't ready to hire full-time</li>
            <li>Organizations with internal design teams who need strategic oversight and elevated creative direction</li>
            <li>Companies navigating a critical growth phase (fundraising, acquisition, major product launch)</li>
            <li>Leadership teams who value having a trusted creative advisor on speed-dial</li>
            <li>Brands that have already worked with Meddle and want to maintain momentum</li>
        </ul>
